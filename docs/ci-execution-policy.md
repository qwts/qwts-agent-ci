# CI execution policy

Every governed repository keeps its agreed validations: agents check drafts
locally, ready PRs prove their head, the queue validates the exact candidate,
and `main` reuses queue evidence. Public-fork workflows never run.

This baseline comes from
[ENG-0004](https://github.com/qwts/agent-sop/blob/main/docs/decisions/ENG-0004-centralize-shared-cicd.md) and inherited under
[ENG-0008](https://github.com/qwts/agent-sop/blob/main/docs/decisions/ENG-0008-shared-sop-inheritance.md). Repositories map
existing gates onto its lanes; only timing and deduplication change.

Release-input policy is repository-specific, and a generated release projection
is a distinct lifecycle object from the source PR that fed it — see
[Changesets, version PRs, and releases](#changesets-version-prs-and-releases).

## Runtime actor boundary

Allowed runtime actors are:

- the human owner `qwts`;
- the release/versioning App `chores-dumb` (runtime actor
  `chores-dumb[bot]`);
- Dependabot (runtime actor `dependabot[bot]`); and
- every active App in [`governance/agents.json`](https://github.com/qwts/qwts-agent-org/blob/main/governance/agents.json),
  each of which runs as `<slug>[bot]`.

The immutable action checks both actor fields and rejects `github-actions[bot]`,
GitHub's own `Copilot` actor, external contributors, third parties, and retired
or unregistered Apps. Our `qwts-copilot-agent` App is a roster identity like any
other and is not what this line excludes — the boundary is drawn at Apps we own
and register, not at the harness a change was authored in. Later automation
authenticates as an allowed App. GitHub documents its separate preview control in
[workflow execution protections](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/actions-policies/workflow-execution-protections).

Keep **Settings → Actions → Policies → Workflow execution protections**
disabled while its actor picker cannot represent the native merge-queue bot
or an event-scoped exception. Do not substitute a repository role: that
authorizes unrelated writers.

Every direct non-CI entrypoint invokes the action in authorization-only mode
before checkout or credentials. Reusable workflows inherit the gated caller
event and token. New direct triggers require this gate and dependency edge.

The merge-queue bot remains unauthorized for `merge_group`, manual dispatch,
PR, and non-`main` push events. Only the resulting native queue push may reach
the post-merge lane, and both actor fields must name that bot.

For public repositories, do not approve a fork workflow after GitHub queues it.
Require approval for all external contributors, keep the default workflow token
read-only, and let the immutable action refuse the external actor if a run is
started. Maintainers move an accepted change onto an allowed,
repository-owned branch before validation.

## Pull-request lifecycle

The gate names in this table are categories and examples, not an allow list.
Every pre-existing required or agreed check remains assigned to the appropriate
lane unless a separate reviewed decision explicitly removes it.

| State or event | Required execution |
| --- | --- |
| Draft PR opened or updated | Do not start GitHub Actions automatically. Before marking ready, the agent runs the repository's agreed local gates, including lint, formatting check, typecheck, unit tests, and docs-gov where configured; a missing category is recorded as not applicable. After the branch is pushed, the agent may explicitly dispatch the complete suite for the exact feature-branch SHA and wait for success. |
| PR marked ready | Verify whether the exact PR-head SHA already has a successful manual complete-suite run. Reuse that evidence and report the stable required gate without rerunning expensive jobs; otherwise run every agreed complete-suite gate. |
| Ready PR updated | Cancel the older PR run. Reuse successful complete-suite evidence only when it names the new exact SHA; otherwise execute every complete-suite gate against the new merge candidate. |
| PR enters the merge queue | Run every complete-suite gate against the `merge_group` SHA. Earlier evidence cannot replace validation with current `main` and prior queued changes. |
| Queue merge or push to `main` | If that exact SHA has successful merge-group evidence, run only a short smoke/integration check. Otherwise execute every complete-suite gate as the fail-safe. |
| Manual dispatch | Used for exact-SHA preflight validation before PR promotion, diagnostics, release recovery, workflow testing, and an explicit rerun. A CI dispatch defaults to the complete suite. |
| Public-fork PR | Do not run or approve workflows. |

A ready PR always verifies remote evidence. Its stable gate either proves a
successful manual complete-suite run for that exact head SHA or runs the suite;
older evidence never counts.

Approval adds the PR to the required queue rather than merging directly. Its
synthetic SHA runs the complete suite because it is the exact candidate with
the latest target branch. Public forks are never enqueued; accepted changes
first move to an allowed repository-owned branch.

## Workflow contract

CI uses `pull_request`, `merge_group: checks_requested`, default-branch `push`,
and narrowly described `workflow_dispatch` events. Release tag pushes and
operational recovery workflows remain separate; schedules,
`repository_dispatch`, and `pull_request_target` require a documented
repo-local purpose and must still satisfy the actor policy.

Every job, including the stable gate, is skipped while
`github.event.pull_request.draft` is true. The `opened` event remains so a PR
opened directly as ready receives evidence verification and the complete-suite
fallback; `synchronize` remains so each ready update is checked against
exact-SHA evidence.

The preflight verifier accepts only a successful `workflow_dispatch` run of the
canonical CI workflow for `github.event.pull_request.head.sha`, and confirms
that run's stable `CI` job succeeded. Missing, failed, incomplete, or stale
evidence falls through to the complete suite. The agent waits for the manual
run to finish before opening or promoting the PR; an in-progress run is not
evidence.

Preflight reuse skips dependency installation, the complete suite, inventory,
and duplicate CodeQL, but ready and updated PRs still publish required contexts
through zero-install docs governance.

Use a PR-scoped concurrency group with `cancel-in-progress: true`. Queue runs
use their head ref, replacing obsolete builds without canceling another queue
candidate. One lifecycle workflow prevents equivalent same-commit suites.

Conditional jobs feed stable required gate `CI`, which validates the selected
lane even when expensive children skip. Existing docs-gov, CodeQL, Storybook,
smoke, E2E, compliance, and other agreed contexts remain required unless a
separate reviewed change replaces them.

Advanced CodeQL runs for ready PRs lacking evidence, manual suites, every merge
group, and every `main` push. The default-branch scan remains because queue
analysis cannot own its alerts; language coverage and immutable pins remain.

Retained contexts report on ready PRs and merge-group candidates. Manual
evidence replaces only expensive PR suites, never independent PR contexts or
queue runs. Rollout verifies the merge box; it does not delete gates.

## Runtime budgets and external setup

Every runner job has a finite whole-job backstop; external dependency setup has
a shorter task deadline that names and kills the stalled process tree. The
[CI runtime policy](ci-runtime-policy.md) owns profiles, exceptions, enforcement,
and the shared action contract under
[ENG-0267](https://github.com/qwts/agent-sop/blob/main/docs/decisions/ENG-0267-bounded-ci-runtime.md).

## Changesets, version PRs, and releases

A source PR keeps its repository's reviewed release-input contract; this policy
neither substitutes raw file presence nor adds a contract where none exists.
A generated Version packages PR follows the same exact-SHA lifecycle and proves
semantic `releases.length` is zero, but it is never required to retain the
Changesets it consumed. Non-README input or `.changeset/pre.json` runs
`changeset status --output`; malformed or positive state fails closed. Empty
markers are forbidden.

Classification comes only from reviewed
[`release-lifecycles.json`](../governance/release-lifecycles.json) and
GitHub evidence. A Version projection must match its base, head, canonical head
repository, and author. A harness projection additionally requires exactly one
well-formed playbook source commit, and its complete PR file list contains only
paths in the managed harness inventory; both rename paths must be managed.
Missing or ambiguous provenance and any product, Changeset, or unmanaged path
retain source policy, including after a Version PR and harness rebase.

Branch names, PR inputs, or bot authorship alone grant nothing. Ordinary
automation, including Dependabot, keeps source policy; public forks are refused;
authorization checks both `github.actor` and `github.triggering_actor`.

The pull request a run belongs to is resolved from GitHub-owned evidence under
`pull-requests: read`, which neither authorizes an actor nor grants write
access:

| Lane | Origin |
| --- | --- |
| `pull_request` | the event payload |
| `merge_group` | the pull request named by the GitHub-owned queue head ref, so an entry queued behind it cannot weaken its policy |
| Manual and post-merge | the pull requests associated with the exact `github.sha` |

Only a run's sole origin may be a projection; mixed origins fail closed. No
associated PR means missing context, so pre-PR manual preflight still runs.
Changesets consumers skip source input only for `generated-projection` and
`harness-projection` modes; every other gate remains.

Tagging and release workflows consume the successful complete-suite evidence
for that exact commit instead of rerunning generic lint, format, typecheck,
unit, Storybook, E2E, security, docs-gov, or other merge gates. Before
publishing, they fail closed unless they can prove all of the following:

- the tag and release source resolve to the intended commit on the protected
  default branch;
- that exact commit has successful complete-suite evidence from its merge-group
  run or the fail-safe default-branch run, and its reviewed PR head had a
  successful ready-PR verification gate; and
- version, changeset, tag, and release provenance are internally consistent.

Release-specific work is not duplicate CI and remains mandatory. This includes
building the distributable from the release source, packaging, signing,
notarization, checksums, asset inspection, install or launch checks, and smoke
or E2E coverage that exercises the packaged release mode rather than the
already-tested development build. Repositories may instead promote an
immutable previously built artifact only when they preserve equivalent source,
provenance, integrity, and signing guarantees.

An explicit release-recovery dispatch follows the same rule. If exact-commit
evidence is missing, it may trigger the complete suite for that commit and wait
for success, or stop without publishing; it must not silently treat release
packaging as a substitute for the merge gate.

## Required repository settings

- Require `CI` and every retained independent governance/security context.
- Require merge queue with merge method `MERGE`, grouping strategy `ALLGREEN`,
  one concurrent candidate build, and one PR per merge.
- Allow merge commits in repository settings; the queue controls their use on
  protected default branches.
- Keep workflow-execution protections disabled until GitHub can represent the
  required system actors without authorizing a broad repository role.
- Require approval for all external-contributor workflows and never approve a
  public-fork workflow.
- Keep the default workflow token read-only and retain the action-source allow
  list plus full-commit-SHA pinning.
- Require the exact merge candidate to pass every complete-suite gate.
- Use CodeQL advanced setup so draft, ready, queue, and post-merge execution
  follows the same lifecycle controller. After the workflow lands, choose
  **Settings → Advanced Security → CodeQL analysis → Switch to advanced**,
  disable default setup, dispatch CI, and verify the required `CodeQL` context
  before merging.

Workflow execution protections are currently a GitHub public-preview setting.
Until GitHub can express the governed system-actor exception and provides a
stable management API, its disabled state and the default-to-advanced CodeQL
switch are manual settings with review evidence attached to the rollout PR.

The owner-aware merge path, semantic Changesets contract, required-context
publishers, privileged credentials, repository settings, and concurrency
follow-up are specified in the [rollout checklist](governed-ci-rollout.md).
